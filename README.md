## My Process

### Built With

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that significantly speeds up the development process.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A powerful state management library for managing application state in React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom, responsive designs with ease.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for adding smooth animations and interactive motion effects to web applications.

### What I Learned

I have become more comfortable using React Redux Toolkit (RTK) and Framer Motion. I feel like my productivity has slightly increased, although thinking about the logic before writing the actual implementation is still a challenge for me.

### Continued Development

I aim to try out Cypress testing using this project.
